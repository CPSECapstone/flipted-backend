# Coding styles

1. Always add a return type to a function defintion. This is something that the compiler are able to figure out even we don't add a return type. However, by add the return type, it's more human-readable.
2. Remove unused import statements
3. Remove unused variables, arguments.
4. Always format code with `prettier`
5. Catch `error` from async function
