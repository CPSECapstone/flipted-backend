Investigation Instructions,Text,TE 1.2,5,"Retrieve your pitcher of iced cold water, two thermometers, and a measuring cup. 
Pour equal amounts of water (400 mL) into each of the two cups. 
Place a thermometer in each cup (through the straw hole if necessary), place the lids on the cups.
Measure initial temperature after waiting 1 minute. Record the data in your chart.

Investigating a System,Text,TE 2.1,1,"When scientists are trying to understand a phenomenon, they think of it and study it in terms of systems. They identify the important parts of the system and how those parts work together. This can give them clues about what to pay attention to and test. Let’s think of our cups as systems. We’ll call one the regular cup system and the other, the fancy cup system.",,,,,,,,
What is a system,Text,TE 2.1,1,"A system is a group of parts that interact together.
There are many different systems out there. 
Our solar system is a system; its parts are the Sun, the planets, and all the moons and other rocks and pieces.
A human being is a system; its parts include all of the organs, blood, tissues, and cells.
A bicycle is also a system; its parts include the chain, the tire, the frame and even the rider.",,,,,,,,
